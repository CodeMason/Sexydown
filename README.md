# Sexydown
Sexydown is a simple way to print a nice looking Markdown document. If you're like me and love to use Markdown for regular, everday documents, then you will love this website.

It uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for Markdown parsing and [textile-js](https://github.com/borgar/textile-js) for Textile parsing.
